Solving pattern formation and active matter PDEs with NGsolve
2d meshes, variety of domains include with holes, some inhomogeneous Dirichlet Boundaries. 
For Pattern formation: Gray-Scott, Brusselator and Complex Ginzburg Landau.
Active matter less successful, and so far only a perhaps not working version of Toner Tu.
